                I am truly sorry for the way I acted earlier. I was hurt and didn’t know how to express my feelings properly.
                I never meant to make you feel bad, and I know I was wrong. You mean the world to me, and I never want to hurt you again.
                I love you so much and I appreciate everything you do. Please forgive me.
